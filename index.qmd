Hi there, I'm Emma!

Whenever I'm not procrastinating by watching YouTube tutorials on how to make your own website, I am a PhD student at the LSE Econ Department. Check out my [research](/research/ "Ben Dahmen - Research") or my [CV](/cv.html "Ben Dahmen - CV"), and feel free to get in touch via email while I'm still in that phase of my career where receiving an email is the highlight of my week.
