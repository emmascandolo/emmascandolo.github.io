title: "How do Students React to more Flexible University Systems? The Bologna Process in Italy"
date: 2025-10-18
description: Before the Bologna Process, Italian students faced a single choice regarding higher education. Either enrol in a long university program lasting 4–5 years (single-cycle) or not attend university at all. The reform introduced greater flexibility by restructuring degrees into two cycles—a three-year bachelor’s program followed by an optional two-year master’s degree. I study the impact this has on students' educational choices and wages by the early 30s.

## Abstract

This paper studies how students react when they are exposed to a more flexible university system, with the option of getting a less specialized university degree in shorter time. Using a Regression Discontinuity design that exploits the roll-out of the Bologna Reform in Italy, I compare education and labor market outcomes for cohorts of individuals who were deciding to go to university right before and right after the reform was implemented. Ex-ante, the impact of the reform on university attainment is ambiguous: schooling might increase because more people go to university, but it might also decrease if students who previously would have completed a longer degree now opt to finish studying after a shorter 3-year degree. I show that both mechanisms are at play but that females, on net, spend 0.15 more years in university. This increases female earnings by 1.5-2% while keeping their employment probability constant, implying a return to one year of university of at least 10%. The results are mostly driven by more women graduating from healthcare degrees - a 30% increase - which has important implications on their occupation. They are more likely to work in the healthcare sector, for which a short 3-year degree provides sufficient preparation, and less likely to work in administrative roles. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring educational reforms to the specific demands of different career paths.
